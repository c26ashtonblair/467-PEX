Because I’ve been to a million auditions and the 
same thing happens every time. Where I get interrupted
because someone wants to get a sandwich. Or I’m crying and they 
start laughing. Or there’s people sitting in the waiting room, 
and they’re, they’re like me but prettier and better at the…because 
maybe I’m not good enough. Maybe I’m one of those people that has always
wanted to do it, but it’s like a pipe dream for me. You know, and then you, 
you said it. You change your dreams and then you grow up. Maybe I’m one of
those people and I’m not supposed to. And I can go back to school and I can find 
something else that I’m supposed to do. Cause I left to do that. And it’s been six 
years and I don’t wanna do it anymore.
